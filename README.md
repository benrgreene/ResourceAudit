# Resource Auditer

This is a tool meant to run audits on websites for checking the resources used, mainly third party.

There are two commands to run:

 * `-u <url>`: runs an resource audit on the URL passed.
 * `-a <api_key>`: sets the API key to use on the machine.

It is important to note that you **need** and API from [Web Page Test](https://www.webpagetest.org/) key to use the tool!
